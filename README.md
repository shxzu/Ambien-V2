Fork of [Ambien](https://github.com/iiiiiiiris/Ambien) made for **messing around, testing new stuff, and eventually adding a GUI**.  
Donâ€™t expect everything to be stable right now â€” this is more of a playground for experiments and feature improvements.  

---

## ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s the point?  

- Try out new features without breaking the original project  
- Improve / tweak things here and there  
- Build a GUI soonâ„¢ so itâ€™s easier to use  
- Basically: just have fun testing stuff  

---

## ðŸ›  Current Status  

- Core features from upstream âœ…  
- Random improvements / tests âœ…  
- GUI ðŸŽ¨ â€” coming soon  

---

## ðŸ”§ How to run it  

Clone this fork:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shxzu/Ambien-V2.git
cd Ambien-V2
```

Build it (same as upstream):  
```bash
./gradlew build
```

Then do your thing.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes  

- This repo is **experimental** â€” use at your own risk.  
- If it breaksâ€¦ it breaks. Thatâ€™s the point ðŸ˜…  
- Once the GUI lands, Iâ€™ll push proper builds in the Releases tab.
